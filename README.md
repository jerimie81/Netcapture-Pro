NetCapture Pro is a modular, terminal-based network forensics tool built for authorized penetration testers, network administrators, and security researchers. Capture live traffic from a target IP, fingerprint devices (MAC, vendor, OS via TTL), and automatically classify traffic by type — social media, messaging, VoIP, streaming, gaming, and more. The Analyze module reconstructs human-readable messages from .pcap files across platforms including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp Web, TextPlus, XMPP, and SIP/VoIP. The Decrypt module supports TLS decryption via SSLKEYLOGFILE, WPA2-PSK Wi-Fi decryption, and interactive payload decoding (Base64, URL, Hex, JSON). All findings are exported as a rich self-contained HTML report, plain text summary, and structured JSON — ready for archiving or further analysis.
⚠️ For authorized use only — on devices you own or have explicit written permission to test.
